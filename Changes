The first version failed a lot of tests on the CPAN tester's
matrix. The cause was that Balinese and some other script names were
only added in Unicode version 5.0.0. To work around this problem, I
changed the list of properties to be a hash with the property names as
keys and the Unicode version which the property appeared in as a
value.

I added the version numbers based on trial and error testing with the
Perl 5.8.8 supplied with Ubuntu linux and a self-compiled version of
Perl 5.10. The problem is that this might fail on versions of Perl and
Unicode I don't have available, so I'll be watching the tester's
matrix to see what happens.

Hopefully at some point this can move to a saner system.
